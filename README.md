# Postgres Manager (pgmgr)

Utility for web applications to manage their Postgres database in a
reliable, consistent manner. Inspired by [mattes/migrate]
(http://www.github.com/mattes/migrate), but with several benefits:

* Migration version numbers are timestamp-based, not sequential. This saves
  significant headaches when multiple developers are working on the same
  application in parallel. However, `pgmgr` is still compatible with your
  old migrations.
* `pgmgr` can generate database dumps, with seed data included, so that
  there's a single, authoritative source of your database structure. It's
  recommended you regularly check this file into source control.

## Getting Started

First, create a `.pgmgr.json` file in your app, as described below. Then,
generate your first migration:

```
$ pgmgr migration MyFirstMigration

Created migrations/1433277961_MyFirstMigration.up.sql
Created migrations/1433277961_MyFirstMigration.down.sql
```

Flesh it out:
```
$ echo 'CREATE TABLE foos (foo_id INTEGER)' > 1433277961_MyFirstMigration.up.sql
```

Bootstrap your database:
```
$ pgmgr db create
Database pgmgr-test-app created successfully.
```

And apply your migration:
```
$ pgmgr db migrate
== Applying 1433277961_MyFirstMigration.up.sql ==
== Completed in 8 ms ==
```

## Configuration

`pgmgr` supports file-based configuration (useful for checking into your
source code) and environment-based configuration, which always overrides
the former (useful for production deploys, Docker usage, etc).

### .pgmgr.json

By default, `pgmgr` will look for a file named `.pgmgr.json` in your
working directory. You can override the file path with the environment
variable `PGMGR_CONFIG_FILE`. It should look something like:

```
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 5432,
  "username": "test",
  "password": "test",
  "database": "testdb",
  "sslmode": "disable",
  "migration-table": "public.schema_migrations",
  "migration-folder": "db/migrate",
  "dump-file": "db/dump.sql",
  "column-type": "integer",
  "format": "unix",
  "seed-tables": [ "foos", "bars" ]
}
```

The `column-type` option can be `integer` or `string`, and determines
the type of the `schema_migrations.version` column. The `string` column
type will store versions as `CHARACTER VARYING (255)`.

The `format` option can be `unix` or `datetime`. The `unix` format is
the integer epoch time; the `datetime` uses versions similar to ActiveRecord,
such as `20150910120933`. In order to use the `datetime` format, you must
also use the `string` column type.

The `migration-table` option can be used to specify an alternate table name
in which to track migration status. It defaults to the schema un-qualified
`schema_migrations`, which will typically create a table in the `public`
schema unless the database's default search path has been modified. If you
use a schema qualified name, pgmgr will attempt to create the schema first
if it does not yet exist.

### Environment variables

The values above map to these environment variables:

* `PGMGR_HOST`
* `PGMGR_PORT`
* `PGMGR_USERNAME`
* `PGMGR_PASSWORD`
* `PGMGR_DATABASE`
* `PGMGR_SSLMODE`
* `PGMGR_DUMP_FILE` (the filepath to dump the database definition out to)
* `PGMGR_SEED_TABLES` (tables to include data with when dumping the database)
* `PGMGR_COLUMN_TYPE`
* `PGMGR_FORMAT`
* `PGMGR_MIGRATION_TABLE`

If you prefer to use a connection string, you can set `PGMGR_URL` which will supersede the other configuration settings, e.g.:

```
PGMGR_URL='postgres://test:test@localhost/testdb?sslmode=require'
```

Also, for host, port, username, password, and database, if you haven't set a
value via the config file, CLI arguments, or environment variables, pgmgr will
look at the standard Postgres env vars (`PGHOST`, `PGUSERNAME`, etc).

## Usage

```
pgmgr migration MigrationName   # generates files for a new migration
pgmgr db create                 # creates the database if it doesn't exist
pgmgr db drop                   # drop the database
pgmgr db migrate                # apply un-applied migrations
pgmgr db rollback               # reverts the latest migration, if possible.
pgmgr db load                   # loads the schema dump file from PGMGR_DUMP_FILE
pgmgr db dump                   # dumps the database structure & seeds to PGMGR_DUMP_FILE
```
